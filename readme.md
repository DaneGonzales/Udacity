# Data Exploration on Ford GoBike Trips
## by Dane Lovell Gonzales


## Dataset

> The dataset contains information about individual rides made in Ford GoBike bike-sharing system in February 2019, covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The data has been assessed and cleaned before exploration. Data quality issues such as missing data and incorrect data types were addressed. Additional details were also extracted from existing features to obtain more meaningful insights. The main features of interest are duration, time of day, and day of week, while the supporting features are user type, gender, age, and "Bike Share for All" membership.


## Summary of Findings

> Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate explorations were performed on the variables. The average trip takes about 796 seconds. It varies slightly depending on whether a user is a subscriber or a customer. Apart from that, none of the other variables had a significant impact on the trip duration. The highest number of trips are taken on 8:00 and 17:00 and on weekdays (particularly Thursdays). This varies depending on the user type and whether the trip was purchased under a "Bike Share For All" membership.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Plots to support the key insights are included in the presentation - 1) the average trip duration based on user type 2) number of trips per hour and day based on user type and "Bike Share for All" membership. All plots are taken from the explonatory analysis section but will be polished appropriately.
